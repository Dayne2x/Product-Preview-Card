## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This is the first ever project I did at FrontEnd Mentor. With the use of @media queries I have also achieved optimal responsiveness when viewed on mobile devices, as well as implementing active states as required.


### Continued development

I aim to research and learn more methods for a quicker setup of a basic layout of the webpage.
